# Asénuve Nakapa

Asénuve Nakapa is a longtime worldbuilding project of mine (Ikoinufe Eivuhekoi)
This Git-repository mainly serves as a way for me to keep my Obsidian documents
up-to-date if I am to work on them on multiple projects. Afaik Obsidian has a
"native" way to do this, but I don't feel like using this.  
As a result, these files are best viewed when opened as a vault using Obsidian,
but feel free to view them as pure markdown too, although in that case the
linking features of Obsidian will hinder readibility.
