Wishing is the magic system of **A shattered world**, which has existed always existed in some form<br>or another within Nakapa. However, the way in which wishing has been utilized has changed a lot<br>over the course of Nakapa's history. From the chaotic nature, and basically nonexistance of<br>wishing during the Primordial times, to the mechaniced technological usage of wishing during the<br>post-collapse world.

# Eiké

Eiké is the oldest form of wishing, as well as where the name itself originates from. A practicioner<br>of Eiké uses essence directly by making a wish of what they want to do. As such, Eiké is viewed as<br>error prone as there is no guarentee that event the most experienced practicioners would always<br>be successful. However, this is offset by the near limitless potential of what essence can do when used in Eiké.

# Ejkléz

Ejkléz is an alternative way of using wishing, were instead of the practicioner using essence<br>directly, they instead use it as fuel for various tools. Fundamentally the tools act as a sorta<br>*wishing medium* that manipulates essence in consistent predictable ways, however with the<br>downside being that more complicated manipulations reguire more parts and thus more<br>essence than a practicioner of Eiké would use for the same wish.

As such, Ejkléz is mainly reserved for small scale tools and weaponry, with the occasional<br>large scale weapon such as the [[Breakers]] seen during the [[Collapse of Nakapa]].

# Wishing trees

Wishing trees are fragments of the [[Ashtree]] which were scattered around Nakapa during<br>the [[Shattering of Nakapa|shattering]]. They are potent sources of essence, and thus higly valuable as essence is what fuels wishing. Conflicts over wishing trees were a large part of what caused the Collapse of Nakapa.
